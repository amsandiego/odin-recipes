    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Seasoned bits of pork or lamb are allowed to season in a Mediterranean marinade
        for as long as you can stand it! Wonderful with rice and a cucumber and tomato salad.
        Serve with lemon slices and chopped parsley.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds pork tenderloin, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves, broken into pieces, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pork tenderloin cubes into a gallon-sized resealable bag.</li>
        <li>Stir olive oil, dry white wine, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour over pork in the bag and mix well.</li>
        <li>Let pork marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 day, up to 5 days.</li>
        <li>Remove pork cubes from marinade and thread onto metal skewers. Place bay leaf pieces between meat cubes.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Arrange skewers on the preheated grill. Turn the kabobs and baste with marinade frequently for the first 10 minutes of cooking, then discard marinade. Cook about 5 minutes longer, until pork is cooked through and juices run clear.</li>
