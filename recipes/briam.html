    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Briam is a traditional Greek roasted vegetable dish with potatoes, zucchini, tomatoes, and red onions with lots of olive oil. It is a typical example of Greek cuisine where a few simple ingredients are turned into an utterly delicious dish with little effort. It can be served as a main course. With olive oil as the only source of fat it is a quintessential example of the Mediterranean diet, and it is vegan to boot. If preferred, serve with a hearty chunk of feta on the side.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 large zucchini, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 small red onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>6 ripe tomatoes, pureed</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
        <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread potatoes, zucchini, and red onions in a 9x13-inch baking dish, or preferably a larger one. Use 2 baking dishes if necessary. Cover with pureed tomatoes, olive oil, parsley. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Toss all ingredients together so that the vegetables are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, stirring after 1 hour, until vegetables are tender and moisture has evaporated, about 90 minutes. Cool slightly before serving, or serve at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
